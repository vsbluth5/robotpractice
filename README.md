Who runs the world? Robots.
(most likely female ones)


When you live preview your html file you should see the head of a robot appear on your screen. Unfortunately, our robot can't actually move yet, something that will be your job to fix.

When you click on the face of the robot, have both eyes turn yellow to signal that the robot is on.

When you click on either of the antennae, make the antenna that you clicked on rotate so that it is straight and turn purple

Clicking on the mouth of the robot should make it speak to you. Have the text with id "hello" appear above the robots head that says "Hi my name is ____" with your chosen robot name

Add three spheres around the robot head, one red, one yellow, and one green.

clicking on the red sphere should turn your bot "evil". It is up do you what this means. Some possible suggestions are turning the eyes red, the mouth black and making the text "mwuhaha I'm an evil robot" appear
clicking on the green sphere should grow your robot using the scale attribute. Make sure that every entity in the robot is scaled.
clicking on the yellow sphere should change the sky background, use this when your bot is needing a change of scenery. You should set the sky's material to your robots happy place.
Extensions....
build out your robot, give her/him a body, legs and arms that do different things when you click on them.
add sound to your scene, make turning on your robot also start a sound file of whatever noise your robot makes when you turn it on.
scatter your robots parts across the scene, then make a sphere that will cause all of the parts to move to the correct location when you click it.
decorate the room your robot is in, try out <a/ocean> or check out the a-frame registry for other cool add-on ideas.
instead of rotating the antennae so that they stand up straight try appending an animation tag to it so that it continuously rotates.
